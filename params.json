Students will learn to understand the Data Science process and the difference between deductive hypothesis-driven and inductive data-driven modeling. Students will have hands-on experience with various on-line analytical processing and data mining software and complete a project using real data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## Our plan\r\nThe plan this semester is to work through the analysis of real world datasets provided by the data science website called kaggle.com. The class will be heavily structured around these projects. In fact, there will be only two examinations (1 midterm and 1 final). These will be on the theory of data science and the algorithms covered throughout class. The most important component of the course will be the practical experience gained as a data scientist, and this will be built upon by exploring:\r\n\r\nTargeted data science lessons on concepts discussed in class. The topics will vary from week to week. They are designed to build up your skills to accomplish the next two tasks.\r\nPredicting the survival rate on the titanic (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted). This is the first data science competition that we will do as a class. As we progress through the class, there will be a number of assignments focused on this prediction task.\r\n\r\nEach week will have a consistent schedule. The first class will be traditional lecture style with a heavy emphasis on interactive discussion, where I will go over the theory behind the algorithms and concepts. The second class will be mostly lab style. My goal is to be your guide as you gain experience being a data scientist. This time will also be used to teach you the R programming language as well. It is during this second class and out of the classroom that you will gain practical experience as a data scientist. If you have laptops, please bring them to the second class of each week.\r\n\r\n## Course Details\r\n### Required Book\r\nReference: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf\r\n\r\n### Contact Information\r\n* Professor: Dr. Paul Anderson\r\n* Office: 313 HWEA\r\n* Office Hours: Tuesday and Thursday from 10 to 11.

Plusses and minuses will be used at the discretion of the instructor.\r\n\r\nGrading Guidelines: Submitted work requires Analysis, Evaluation, and Creation of ideas, concepts, and materials into various deliverables (e.g., see revised Bloom's Taxonomy and reference below).\r\n\r\nThe grade of A is for work that involves high-quality achievement in all three Bloom areas.\r\nThe grade of B is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least two Bloom areas, and medium-level achievement in the other.\r\nThe grade of C is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least one Bloom area, and medium-level achievement in the others.\r\nThe grade of F is for work that does not meet above criteria.\r\nReference: Errol Thompson, Andrew Luxton-Reilly, Jacqueline L. Whalley, Minjie Hu, and Phil Robbins. 2008. Bloom's taxonomy for CS assessment.

Australian Computer Society, Inc., Darlinghurst, Australia, Australia, 155-161.\r\n\r\n### Homework Policy\r\n\r\nWritten homework must be placed under my office door by 5 PM on the due date. No late homework will be accepted. Cheating/sharing will result in a zero on the assignment and a report to the judicial board.\r\n\r\n### Programming Assignments\r\n\r\nMost programming assignments will be submitted through the Learn2Mine environment. There will be a combination of in-class lab assignments, and out of class programming assignments.\r\n\r\n### Honor Code\r\n\r\nYou must do your work alone (or with your teammates, for group assignments).\r\nYou must identify your sources of material and inspiration. It is a violation of the honor code to present someone else's work or ideas as your own.\r\nIn any course deliverable, you must always identify the person(s) that helped you (directly or indirectly), if any, and explain their contribution to your work.\r\nAlso see the College of Charleston Student Handbook, especially sections on The Honor Code (p. 11), and Student Code of Conduct (p. 12). There is other useful information there.\r\nClassroom Policies\r\n\r\nYou are expected to take good notes during class.\r\nYou are expected to participate in class with questions and invited discussion.\r\nYou are expected to attend all classes. The grade 'WA' will be given for excessive (>= 3) absences. If you miss class, you must get an absence memo from the Associate Dean of Students Office; also, you are responsible for announcements made in class, assignment due dates, etc.\r\nYou should turn off all electronic devices (e.g., cell phones, pagers, etc.).\r\nIn summary, you should contribute positively to the classroom learning experience, and respect your classmates right to learn (see College of Charleston Student Handbook, section on Classroom Code of Conduct (p. 58)).\r\nLate Policy\r\n\r\nNo late days will be allowed without an excuse. Falling behind on assignments will make it difficult to achieve the learning outcomes of this course.\r\n\r\n## Midterm\r\n\r\nThe is scheduled for Tuesday, October 25th\r\n\r\n## Final (Final Project)\r\n\r\nThere will be no final exam. The final exam time will be used for data science competition presentations and judging. Last year we participated in the Wells Fargo Analytics Competition. This is tentatively what we plan to do again this semester though it depends on scheduling.\r\n\r\nhttp://today.cofc.edu/2016/01/12/data-science-students-win-wells-fargo-analytics-challenge/\r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\n(All details are subject to change)\r\n\r\n### Week 1 (8/23)\r\n* Introduction to Course\r\n* Introduction to the Field of Data Science\r\n* Introduction to Programming Environment\r\n\r\n#### Homework 1\r\nPost 1 popular press article related to data science to Facebook group.
